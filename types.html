	<h2>Types of Database Management Systems</h2>
	<h3>There are several types of database management systems such as:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Hierarchical databases</li>
		<li>Network databases</li>
		<li>Relational databases</li>
	<ul>
	<table style="width:80%;font-size:25px;">
		<th>Hierarchical Databases</th>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<p>
					In a hierarchical database management system (hierarchical DBMSs) model, data is stored in a 
					parent-children relationship node. In a hierarchical database, besides actual data, records also 
					contain information about their groups of parent/child relationships.
				</p>
			</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
		<th>Network Databases</th>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<p >
					Network database management systems (Network DBMSs) use a network structure to create a relationship 
					between entities. Network databases are mainly used on large digital computers. Network databases are 
					hierarchical databases, but unlike hierarchical databases where one node can have a single parent only, 
					a network node can have a relationship with multiple entities. A network database looks more like a 
					cobweb or interconnected network of records.

		</tr>
		<th>Relational Databases</th>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<p>
					In a relational database management systems (RDBMS), the relationship between data is relational and 
					data is stored in tabular form of columns and rows. Each column if a table represents an attribute 
					and each row in a table represents a record. Each field in a table represents a data value. 
					Structured Query Language (SQL) is the language used to query RDBMS, including inserting, updating, 
					deleting, and searching records. Relational databases work on each table that has a key field that 
					uniquely indicates each row. These key fields can be used to connect one table of data to another.
